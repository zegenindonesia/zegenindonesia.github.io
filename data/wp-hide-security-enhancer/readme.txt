When testing with WordPress theme and plugins detector services/sites, any setting change may not reflect right away on their reports, since they use cache. So you may want to check again later, or try a different inner url, homepage url usage is not mandatory.

Being the best content management system, widely used, WordPress is susceptible to a large range of hacking attacks including brute-force, SQL injections, XSS, XSRF etc. Despite the fact the WordPress core is a very secure code maintained by a team of professional enthusiast, the additional plugins and themes makes the vulnerable spot of every website. In many cases, those are created by pseudo-developers who do not follow the best coding practices or simply do not own the experience to create a secure plugin. 
Statistics reveal that every day new vulnerabilities are discovered, many affecting hundreds of thousands of WordPress websites. 
Over 99,9% of hacked WordPress websites are target of automated malware scripts, who search for certain WordPress fingerprints. This plugin hide or replace those traces, making the hacking boots attacks useless.

Works fine with custom WordPress directory structures e.g. custom plugins, themes, uplaods folder.

Once configured, you need to **clear server cache data and/or any cache plugins** (e.g. W3 Cache), for a new html data to be created. If use CDN this should be cache clear as well.

**Sample usage**
[vimeo https://vimeo.com/192011678]

**Main plugin functionality:**

* Custom Admin Url
* Block default admin Url
* Block any direct folder access to completely hide the structure
* Custom wp-login.php filename

* Block XML-RPC API
* New XML-RPC path

and many more.

**No other plugins functionality is being blocked or interfered in any way, everything will function the same**

This plugin allow to change default Admin Url's from **wp-login.php** and **wp-admin** to something else. All original links return default theme 404 Not Found page, like nothing exists there. Beside the huge security advantage, this save lots of server processing time by reducing php code and MySQL usage since brute-force attacks trigger wrong urls.

**Important:** Compared to all other similar plugins which mainly use redirects, this plugin return a default theme 404 error page for all **block url** functionality, so is not revealing at all the link existence.

Since version 1.2 Change individual plugin urls which make them unrecognizable, for example change default WooCommerce plugin urls and dependencies from domain.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/ to domain.com/ecommerce/cdn/ or anything customized.

Feel free to contact us at contact@wp-hide.com for fast support.

= Does the plugin change anything on my server  =

Absolute None! 
No files and directories are being changed on your server, everything is processed virtually! The plugin code use URL rewrite techniques and WordPress filters to apply all internal functionality and features.

= I have no PHP knowledge at all, is this plugin for me? =

There's no requirements on php knowledge. All plugin features and functionality are applied automatically, controlled through a descriptive admin interface.

= Is there any demo I can check? =

A demo instance can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.wp-hide.com/">https://demo.wp-hide.com/</a> or our own website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wp-hide.com/">WP Hide and Security Enhancer</a>

= Can I still update WordPress, my plugins and themes?  =

Everything works as before, no functionality is being broken. You can run updates at any time.

= Does the plugin affect the SEO aspects of my website?  =

No, the plugin changes only assets links ( CSS, JavaScript, media files ) and not actual content URLs. There will be no negative impact from SEO perspective, whatsoever. 

= Does the plugin work with my site cache?  =

Yes, the plugin works with any cache plugin deployed on your site.

= What servers this plugin can work with =

This free code can with Apache, IIS server types and any other set-up which rely on .htaccess usage.
For all other checks the PRO version at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wp-hide.com">WP Hide PRO</a>

= How to make it work with my OpenLiteSpeed server =

There are few things to consider when run on litespeed servers:

* Ensure the liteserver actually process the .htaccess file where the rewrite data is being saved. Check with the following topic regarding this issue <a target="_blank" href="https://www.litespeedtech.com/support/forum/threads/htaccess-is-ignored.15500/">Post</a>

* If you use Litespeed Cache plugin, in the Optimization Settings area, disable the CSS / JS Minify

* If your litespeed server requires to place the rewrite lines in a different file e.g. config file or interface, consider upgrading to PRO version which includes a Setup page where you can get the rewrite code <a href="https://www.wp-hide.com/wp-hide-pro-now-available/">WP Hide PRO</a>.


= How to use on my Bitnami setup =
As default, on Bitnami LAMP set-ups, the system will not process the .htaccess file, so none of the rewrites will work. You can change this behavior by updating the main config file located at /opt/bitnami/apps/APPNAME/conf/httpd-app.conf , update the line 
<pre><code>AllowOverride None</code></pre>
to
<pre><code>AllowOverride All</code></pre>
Restart the Apache service through ssh
<pre><code>sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart</code></pre>
More details can be found at <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/general/apps/redmine/administration/use-htaccess/">Bitnami Default .Htaccess
</a>

You can still keep the configuration as is using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wp-hide.com">WP Hide PRO</a>, more details at <a href="https://www.wp-hide.com/documentation/setup-the-plugin-on-bitnami-wordpress-lamp-stack/">Setup the plugin on Bitnami WordPress LAMP stack
</a>


= .htaccess file writing error - Unable to write custom rules to your .htaccess. Is this file writable? =

I'm seeing this error "Unable to write custom rules to your .htaccess. Is this file writable"  what does it mean?
The error appear when the plugin is not able to write to .htaccess file located in your WordPress root. You can try the followings to make a fix:

* Check if your .htaccess file is writable. This can be different from server to server, but usually require rw-rw-r– / 0664 Also ensure the file owner is the same group as php

* Sometimes the other codes wrongly use the flush_rules() which hijack the default filters for rewrite. Try to disable the other plugins and theme to figure out which ones produce the issue.

* De-activate and RE-activate the plugin, apparently worked for some users.

* Create a backup of .htaccess, then delete it from the server. Go to Settings > Permalinks > update once, this should create the file again on the WordPress root. If so, try to change any WP Hide options which will update the .htaccess content accordingly.

= Something is wrong, what can I do? How can I recover my site? =

* First, stay calm. There will be no harm, guaranteed :)
* Go to admin and change some of the plugin options to see which one causes the problem. Then report it to the forum or get in touch with us to fix it.
* If you can't log in to admin, use the Recovery Link which has been sent to your e-mail. This will reset the login to default.
* If you can't find the recovery link or none of the above worked, delete the plugin from your wp-content/plugins directory. Then remove any lines in your .htaccess file between 
 BEGIN WP Hide & Security Enhancer
..
 END WP Hide & Security Enhancer 

* At this point, the site should run as before. If for some reason still not working, you missed something, please get in touch with us at contact@wp-hide.com and we'll fix it for you in no time!

= I can't find a functionality that i'am looking for =
